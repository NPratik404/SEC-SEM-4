# FOOD ORDERING SYSTEM - PROJECT REPORT

## 1. INTRODUCTION

### 1.1 Project Overview
The Food Ordering System is a web-based application designed to facilitate food ordering and management for restaurants. The system allows customers to place orders, view menu items, and track their order status. It also provides restaurant managers with tools to manage orders, view customer records, and analyze business metrics.

### 1.2 Objectives
- Create a user-friendly interface for customers to place food orders
- Implement a robust order management system for restaurant staff
- Provide real-time order tracking and processing
- Generate business analytics for restaurant managers
- Demonstrate the implementation of data structures and algorithms in a practical application

### 1.3 Scope
The system includes the following key features:
- Customer order placement with menu selection
- Order processing and management
- Customer record tracking
- Manager's dashboard with business analytics
- Responsive design for various devices

## 2. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

### 2.1 Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Python with Flask framework
- **Data Structures**: Custom implementations of Stack, Queue, and Array
- **Styling**: Bootstrap framework for responsive design

### 2.2 System Components
1. **User Interface**: HTML/CSS for layout and design
2. **Client-side Logic**: JavaScript for interactive features
3. **Server-side Logic**: Python Flask for API endpoints
4. **Data Management**: Custom data structures for storing orders and customer information

### 2.3 Data Flow
1. Customer places order through the web interface
2. Order data is sent to the server via API
3. Server processes the order and stores it in appropriate data structures
4. Restaurant staff can view and process pending orders
5. Processed orders are moved to order history
6. Customer records are updated based on order activity

## 3. IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

### 3.1 Data Structures
The project implements three custom data structures:

#### 3.1.1 Stack (LIFO)
- Used for storing order history
- Operations: push, pop, peek, is_empty, size, get_all
- Implementation: Python list with LIFO operations

#### 3.1.2 Queue (FIFO)
- Used for managing pending orders
- Operations: enqueue, dequeue, peek, is_empty, size, get_all
- Implementation: Python deque with FIFO operations

#### 3.1.3 Array
- Used for storing customer records
- Operations: append, get, set, remove, find, size, get_all
- Implementation: Python list with additional functionality

### 3.2 Frontend Implementation
- **HTML Structure**: Semantic markup for different sections of the application
- **CSS Styling**: Custom styling with responsive design principles
- **JavaScript Functionality**:
  - Menu item selection and quantity management
  - Order form validation
  - API communication for order placement and retrieval
  - Dynamic UI updates based on order status
  - Manager's dashboard with real-time statistics

### 3.3 Backend Implementation
- **Flask Application**: RESTful API endpoints for order management
- **Data Validation**: Input validation for order data
- **Order Processing**: Logic for handling order placement and processing
- **Customer Management**: Tracking customer orders and spending
- **Business Analytics**: Calculation of daily orders, revenue, and customer metrics

### 3.4 API Endpoints
1. `/api/place_order`: Accepts new orders from customers
2. `/api/process_order`: Processes pending orders
3. `/api/order_history`: Retrieves order history
4. `/api/customer_records`: Retrieves customer records
5. `/api/pending_orders`: Retrieves pending orders
6. `/api/todays_orders`: Retrieves orders placed today

- Mobile application

### 7.2 Scalability Considerations
- Database integration for persistent storage
- User session management
- Load balancing for high traffic
- Caching mechanisms for performance

## 8. CONCLUSION

The Food Ordering System successfully demonstrates the implementation of data structures and algorithms in a practical web application. The system provides a comprehensive solution for restaurant order management, from customer order placement to staff processing and manager analytics.

The project showcases the use of custom data structures (Stack, Queue, Array) for efficient data management, along with modern web technologies for creating a responsive and user-friendly interface. The separation of concerns between frontend and backend components follows good software engineering practices.

Through this project, we've created a foundation that can be extended with additional features to meet the evolving needs of restaurants in the digital age.
